                                <p>Robert is trying to highlight how important it is to try newer options while investing. 
                                    Nobody ever made high returns in the stock market without taking risk</p>
                                    <p>In fact, the more the risk you take, the more you might earn. But then again, it is risk.
                                 The more risk you take, the more you might lose too. Rober advocates careful calculated risk-taking.</p>
